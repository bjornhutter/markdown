# Markdown editor made with React.js
This is a simple markdown editor application made with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) and [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked"). 

***

## Usage
You write some markdown in the editor and React magically spits it out on the screen.
